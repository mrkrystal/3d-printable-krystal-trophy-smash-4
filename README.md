# 3D Printable Krystal Trophy from Smash 4

!["Krystal v1 Printed"](example.jpg)

A 3D printable version of Krystal inspired by her trophy pose in Super Smash Bros for Wii U.

Originally based on a mesh ripped from Super Smash Bros for Wii U by ThatTrueStruggle ([The Models Resource Page](https://www.models-resource.com/wii_u/supersmashbrosforwiiu/model/10550/)).

This project was originally announced via the [Krystal Archive on June 10th, 2017](https://krystalarchive.com/2017/06/3d-printable-krystal-version-1-0/).

### [Solid Version](solid/) • [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) • [License](LICENSE.md)

## Technical Fixes

* Adjusted boots to stand flat on the ground
* Removed duplicate geometry
* Removed detatched invisible geometry in the head
* Solidified hair strands
* Reconnected edges that had been separated to avoid for normal sharing in smooth shading mode
* Fixed other non-manifold issues
* Adjusted thighs to avoid a clip-through

## Artistic Modifications

* Closed mouth and removed internal mouth structure - easier to print
* Removed hair tassels - bad geometry for printing

## To Do

* Create alternate version that breaks up the mesh into more easily printed parts at better angles
* Add better hair tassels
* Add holes to bottom of boots to allow the mesh to be held up on a stand
* Create optional Smash Bros Trophy stand mesh
* Increase the polygon count significantly while keeping the overall pose
* Create individual fingers in the mesh
* If feasible, restore open mouth and mouth internals to mesh
* Add jewelry to the surface mesh (forehead)
* Model the clothing at a mesh level
* Model fur as a surface detail for the parts of her skin that aren't clothed (examples [here](http://voronart.com/portfolio-items/wolf-head-digital-sculpture-3d-model/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zizW0btsg))
* Update multi-part version to allow for parts to snap together rather than requiring glue
